Elevators, escalators, and automatic building doors with KONE 24/7 Connected Services are constantly sending data to the cloud where it is analyzed and potential issues are identified. Appropriate action recommendations are then automatically sent to maintenance technicians who will resolve the issues before they happen. The action recommendations are created by a host of algorithms from heuristics to machine learning models. Technician feedback is used to constantly improve these algorithms.

here I created a solution that evaluates the action recommendations and makes the final decision which ones to send to technicians and which ones to discard based on the technician feedback.
